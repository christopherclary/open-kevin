![Screen-Shot-2019-03-04-at-4 54 03-PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40834845/127020111-9c64d03c-ed8b-4307-949e-d66982de96d1.png)

Kevin is a queer art series about online obsession with IRL implications. Finding, loving, stalking, and morning images of an amateur porn star. I was surfing a pay-per-view website in the 90s and found Kevin, actual several hundred images of him. I made a habit of selecting and opening every Kevin on my laptop. I was hoping to find that perfect jpeg. This Java application reenacts my obsession circa 1999 using Mac OS 9 ui/ux. The software loops —  opening and counting in perpetuity until the computer slows, images don't render, and in the end just the tech remains.

Open: Kevin (and porn in general) is about distribution, mediation, and now agency. Create your own 1990s obsession. By mixing in or replacing Kevin in the folder titled "jpegs". Femme things up. Use photos of your cats. Watch your family album go the same way as Kevin — unable to render, awash in a sea of windows.

I saved the application onto a DVD. Each disc is personalized like carving a lover’s name into a tree. Damage and access to the data differs from disk to disk. If you’re unable to access the application because of the scratch marks, download the application here.
